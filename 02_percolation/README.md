# Assignment 2 - Percolation

This module implements the assignment of the Module 2 of the course. The goal of this task is to utilise the union-find
to solve a simple case of the [Percolation problem](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Percolation_theory), focused on 
finding clusters of 1 material in another. The solution complexity is `N*log(N)`.
