# Assignment 4 - Collinear Points

This module implements the assignment of the Module 6 of the course. The goal of this task is to utilise the merge sort
to find the largest cluster of collinear points (points that lie on the same line). While the solution complexity is
`N*N*log(N)`, it's still fast as the brute force solution grows expanentially with the number of points that you expect
to find on the same line.
